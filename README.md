###  ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS IN INDIA – POWER BI DASHBOARD

 ### Project Overview
  This project analyzes road accident data in India using a Power BI dashboard.
The dashboard provides insights into total accidents, casualties, deaths, vehicle involvement, accident severity, weather conditions, and alcohol involvement.
It helps understand accident patterns across states and years and identifies high-risk conditions to support road safety and data-driven decision-making.

## Dataset Information
● Source: Road Accident Dataset (India)
● Format: CSV
● Records: Accident-level data
● Granularity: Year, State, Accident Severity, Vehicle Type, Weather, Alcohol involvement

## Key Columns Used
● Year – Accident year
● State Name – Indian states
● Accident Severity – Minor, Serious, Fatal
● Weather Conditions – Fog, Rainy, Heavy Rain, Normal, Light Fog
● Vehicle Type – Car, Bike, Truck, Bus, Auto, Cycle, Pedestrian
● Alcohol Involvement – Yes / No
● Casualties – People injured
● Deaths – Fatalities

## Objectives of the Project
● Analyze accident trends across years
● Identify high-risk states
● Understand the impact of weather conditions
● Analyze accident severity distribution
● Study vehicle involvement patterns
● Provide interactive filters for deeper analysis

## Dashboard Features
● KPI Cards
● Total Accidents
● Total Casualties
● Total Deaths
● Vehicles Involved

 ## Visualizations Used
● Bar Chart – Accidents by State
● Column Chart – Accidents by Severity
● Line Chart – Accident Trend by Year
● Donut Chart – Vehicle Type Involvement
● Gauge Chart – Total People Affected
## Filters (Slicers)
- Year
- State Name
- Weather Conditions
- Accident Level
- Alcohol Involvement

## Tools & Technologies Used
● Microsoft Power BI
● Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation
● DAX – Measures and calculations
● Microsoft Excel / CSV
● GitHub – Version control & project hosting

## Data Cleaning & Preparation (Step-by-Step)
● Imported CSV file into Power BI
● Checked missing and duplicate values
● Standardized column names
● Converted data types (Year, Counts)
● Created calculated measures using DAX
● Verified relationships and filters

## Measures Created 
● Total Accidents
● Total Casualties
● Total Deaths
● Accident Count by Year
● Accident Count by Severity

## Key Insights :
● Certain states consistently show higher accident counts
● Fatal accidents are fewer than minor and serious accidents
● Rainy and foggy conditions increase accident risk
● Cars and two-wheelers are involved most frequently
● Alcohol involvement significantly impacts accident severity

## How to Use This Project :
1. Download the repository
2. Open Road_Accident_Analysis.pbix in Power BI Desktop
3. Refresh data if required
4. Use slicers to explore insights
5. Interact with visuals for analysis
